### Installation:
```npm install posh-git -g```

### Motivation:
- posh-git is an essential cli tool for every git project, but is only made for windows. However [David](https://github.com/lyze) wrote a bash version! Amazing, eh?
- I use Linux, OS X and Windows, so it's very boring doing a different installation for each platform everytime, so I wanted to make this easy for every OS.
- I choose NPM for 2 reasons: I think that's the most popular package manager for every developer (web developers at least), and because it's easy to upload (unlike chocolatey or apt for eg.).

### Known Issues:
Besides being a new project, I'm not very expert on OSes, so probably there's something to improve. Also, currently I'm focused on Linux version, OS X and Windows are not working (yet.. PRs are welcome!).
