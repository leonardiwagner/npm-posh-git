# npm-posh-git
posh-git installation for Linux, Mac and Windows through NPM.

![posh-git example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonardiwagner/npm-posh-git/master/example.png)

### Installation:
1. Run **```npm install -g posh-git```**
2. If you used sudo to install (sudo npm install -g posh-git), run after ```posh-git-install``` without sudo to complete installation into your actual user.

### Known Issues:
This is a new project, it's currently working only on Linux, I'm working for Windows and Mac installation too. Feel free to open an issue to report an installation fail, bugs or improvements.
