# npm-posh-git
posh-git installation for Linux, Mac and Windows via npm!

![posh-git example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonardiwagner/npm-posh-git/dev/posh-git-demo.gif)

### Installation:
```npm install -g posh-git```

### Motivation:
- posh-git is an essential cli tool for every git project, but is only made for windows. However david(https://github.com/lyze) an amazing version for bash!
- I use linux, osx and windows, so it's very boring doing a different installation for each platform, so I wanted to make this easy
- I choose NPM for 2 reasons: I think that's the most popular package manager for every developer (web developers at least), and because it's easy to upload (unlike chocolatey or apt for eg.).

### Known Issues:
Besides being a new project, I'm not very expert on OSes, so probably there's something to improve. Also, currently I'm focused on Linux version, OS X and Windows are not working (yet).
